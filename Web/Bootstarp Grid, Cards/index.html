                            Autumn, also known as fall, typically begins around September 22nd or 23rd in the Northern Hemisphere.
                            The word "autumn" is believed to have originated from the Latin word "autumnus."
                            It's the season associated with the harvest of crops, making it a critical time for agriculture.
                            In many cultures, autumn is celebrated with various festivals and holidays, such as Halloween and Thanksgiving.
                            Animals, such as birds and monarch butterflies, migrate during the fall to find warmer climates.

                            Autumn weather is characterized by gradually decreasing temperatures 
                            as summer transitions into winter.
                            It's the season with shorter days and longer nights.
                            In some regions, autumn is known for its unpredictable weather, 
                            including occasional cold fronts, rain, and even the first snowfalls of the season.
                            Weather patterns in autumn can vary significantly depending on the geographical location, 
                            with some areas experiencing mild, pleasant temperatures and others witnessing more extreme fluctuations.

                            The changing angle of the Earth's axis and its orbit around the 
                            sun cause the shift in seasons, including the arrival of autumn.
                            Autumn is often associated with lower humidity levels, 
                            making the air feel crisper and drier.
                            In many temperate climates, trees shed their leaves during 
                            autumn as a strategy to conserve water and energy in preparation for the winter months.
                            The transition to autumn weather is a critical trigger for many 
                            plants and animals to prepare for hibernation, dormancy, or migration.
